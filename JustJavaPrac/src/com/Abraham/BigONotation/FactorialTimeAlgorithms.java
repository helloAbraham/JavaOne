    In most cases, this is pretty much as bad as it'll get. This class of algorithms
    has a run time proportional to the factorial of the input size.
    A classic example of this is solving the traveling salesman problem
    using a brute-force approach to solve it.
    An explanation of the solution to the traveling salesman problem is beyond the scope of this article.
    Instead, let's look at a simple O(n!) algorithm, as in the previous sections:

public class FactorialTimeAlgorithms {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
      //  for (int i = 1; i <= factorial(n); i++){
           // System.out.println("Hey - I'm busy looking at: " + i);
      //  }
    }

}
