// This is the example of Logarithmic Time Algorithms â€“ O(log n)

/*
    Constant time algorithms are (asymptotically) the quickest. Logarithmic time is the next quickest.
    Unfortunately, they're a bit trickier to imagine. One common example of a logarithmic time algorithm
    is the binary search algorithm. To see how to implement binary search in Java, click here.
    What is important here is that the running time grows in proportion to the logarithm of the
    input (in this case, log to the base 2):
