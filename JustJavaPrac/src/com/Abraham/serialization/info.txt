Serialization in Java refers to the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. The serialized form of an object is typically a sequence of bytes that represents the object's state and data. Serialization is commonly used for:

    Persistence: Saving the state of an object to a file or a database for later retrieval.
    Communication: Transmitting objects over a network or between different processes.
    Caching: Storing objects in memory or on disk for performance optimization.

    In Java, serialization is achieved using the java.io.Serializable interface.
    Classes that implement this interface can be serialized, meaning their instances can be converted
    into a byte stream and then reconstructed later. The serialization process is handled by the Java runtime,
    and it includes converting the object's state (i.e., its fields) into a byte stream
    and writing it to an output stream.

    Here's an example of a class implementing Serializable:
